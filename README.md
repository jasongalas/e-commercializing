# e-commercializing

## Description

For this module, we were in charge of building out the backend for a fictional e-commerce site. The main focus was creating the models that would seed the postgres SQL database with the given data, as well as building out the routes to allow the full functionality of CRUD. This module was an exercise in creating routes, which was once again an exercise in troubleshooting when routes would go wayward. It was a good reminder in how important setup is, and good practice in going through the process step by step; going out of these steps would ensure problems. In all, it was more reps and more necessary practice.

## Installation

To execute this command line application, first we must run the schema to create the database. Next, 'npm install' to ensure all the necessary packages are in place for the application to properly execute. Finally, 'npm run seed' to seed the database with its relevant information.

## Usage

All of the magic happens in Insomnia. From there, you can access http://localhost:3001/api/categories, http://localhost:3001/api/products, and http://localhost:3001/api/tags. In each of these API calls, you can execute the full range of CRUD: GET information, wholesale or by ID, POST information, PUT information by ID, or DELETE by ID. https://drive.google.com/file/d/12DDC8wxXr8RUIPQHBvjNCyKQKTZawO_e/view
